--1. How many customers are in each city? Your solution should include the city name and the number of customers sorted from highest to lowest.
SELECT city, COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_num_by_city 
FROM sale.customer 
GROUP BY city 
ORDER BY customer_num_by_city DESC;

--2. Find the total product quantity of the orders. Your solution should include order ids and quantity of products.
SELECT order_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity 
FROM sale.order_item 
GROUP BY order_id ;

--3. Find the first order date for each customer_id.
SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date 
FROM sale.orders 
GROUP BY customer_id;

--4. Find the total amount of each order. Your solution should include order id and total amount sorted from highest to lowest.
SELECT order_id, SUM(list_price) AS total_amount 
FROM sale.order_item 
GROUP BY order_id 
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;

--5. Find the order id that has the maximum average product price. Your solution should include only one row with the order id and average product price.
--Solution 1 (without including the discount rate)
SELECT TOP 1 order_id, AVG(list_price) AS average_price 
FROM sale.order_item 
GROUP BY order_id 
ORDER BY average_price DESC;

--Solution 2 (including the discount rate)
SELECT TOP 1 order_id, AVG(quantity *list_price * discount) AS average_price 
FROM sale.order_item 
GROUP BY order_id 
ORDER BY average_price DESC; 

--6. Write a query that displays brand_id, product_id and list_price sorted first by brand_id (in ascending order), and then by list_price  (in descending order).
SELECT brand_id, product_id, list_price 
FROM product.product 
ORDER BY brand_id ASC, list_price DESC;


--7. Write a query that displays brand_id, product_id and list_price, but this time sorted first by list_price (in descending order), and then by brand_id (in ascending order).
SELECT brand_id, product_id, list_price 
FROM product.product 
ORDER BY list_price DESC, brand_id ASC; 


--8. Compare the results of these two queries above. How are the results different when you switch the column you sort on first? (Explain it in your own words.)
--In the first query, the brand_ids are sorted in ascending form. At the same time, the list_prices of the products with the same brand_ids are sorted in descending form.
--In the second query, by giving priority to list_price in decreasing form, branch_ids are sorted in ascending form.


---9. Write a query to pull the first 10 rows and all columns from the product table that have a list_price greater than or equal to 3000.
SELECT TOP 10 * 
FROM product.product 
WHERE list_price > 3000;

---10. Write a query to pull the first 5 rows and all columns from the product table that have a list_price less than 3000.
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM product.product 
WHERE list_price < 3000;

---11. Find all customer last names that start with 'B' and end with 's'.
SELECT last_name FROM sale.customer 
WHERE last_name LIKE 'B%s';

---12. Use the customer table to find all information regarding customers whose address is Allen or Buffalo or Boston or Berkeley.
SELECT * FROM sale.customer 
WHERE city = 'Allen' OR city = 'Buffalo' OR city = 'Boston' OR city = 'Berkeley';
